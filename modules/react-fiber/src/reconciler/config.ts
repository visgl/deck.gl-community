 *

 * - CAN mutate the newly created instance before returning it
 * - CANNOT modify any other nodes in the tree
 * - CANNOT register event handlers on parent tree
 * - CANNOT perform side effects that assume the instance will be used
 * - Instance may be garbage collected if React decides not to commit it

 * descriptors, creating them is very cheap and they're designed to be recreated on updates.
 *
 * **Why Not `commitMount`?**

/**
 * Clones an instance with updated props during reconciliation (persistence mode).
 *
 * React calls this in persistence mode when an element's props change. Instead of mutating
 * the existing instance, we create a new one with updated props. This is the core of
 * persistence mode - every change creates a new immutable tree.
 *
 * **Persistence Mode Flow:**
 * 1. Props change detected in render phase
 * 2. `cloneInstance` creates new instance with new props
 * 3. React rebuilds parent chain up to root with new instances
 * 4. `replaceContainerChildren` commits entire new tree in one shot
 *
 * **Why Clone Instead of Mutate:**
 * Deck.gl layers are designed as immutable descriptors. Creating new layer objects is
 * cheap, and Deck.gl's ID-based diffing efficiently detects what actually changed. This
 * matches React's concurrent rendering model perfectly - render phase can be interrupted
 * without leaving half-mutated trees.
 *
 * **keepChildren Parameter:**
 * - `true` = Reuse existing children array (children didn't change)
 * - `false` = Use `newChildSet` (children were rebuilt due to reordering/additions/removals)
 *
 * React determines this based on whether child reconciliation happened. If children are
 * unchanged, `keepChildren=true` avoids unnecessary work.
 *
 * @param instance - Current instance to clone
 * @param type - Element type (same as original)
 * @param oldProps - Previous props (for comparison if needed)
 * @param newProps - New props to apply
 * @param keepChildren - If true, reuse instance.children; if false, use newChildSet
 * @param newChildSet - New children array when keepChildren is false
 * @returns New instance with updated node and appropriate children
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Component updates from:
 * <layer layer={new ScatterplotLayer({ id: "p", getRadius: 5 })} />
 * // To:
 * <layer layer={new ScatterplotLayer({ id: "p", getRadius: 10 })} />
 *
 * // React calls:
 * const cloned = cloneInstance(
 *   oldInstance,
 *   "layer",
 *   { layer: ScatterplotLayer {getRadius: 5} },
 *   { layer: ScatterplotLayer {getRadius: 10} },
 *   true, // children unchanged
 *   undefined
 * );
 * // Returns: { node: new ScatterplotLayer, children: oldInstance.children }

/**
 * Commits the new tree to Deck.gl by replacing container children (persistence mode).
 *
 * React calls this in the commit phase after all instances have been created/cloned and
 * assembled into a complete tree. This is where we actually update the Deck.gl instance
 * with the new layers and views.
 *
 * **Commit Phase - The Final Step:**
 * This is the culmination of React's reconciliation:
 * 1. Render phase builds new immutable tree (createInstance, cloneInstance)
 * 2. Commit phase builds container child set (createContainerChildSet, appendChildToContainerChildSet)
 * 3. Validation (finalizeContainerChildren)
 * 4. **THIS METHOD** - Actually update Deck.gl
 *
 * **Tree Flattening & Organization:**
 * React's tree is arbitrarily nested (e.g., wrapper components), but Deck.gl expects:
 * - Flat `layers` array
 * - Flat `views` array (optional)
 *
 * We flatten the nested React tree and separate layers from views.
 *
 * **Hybrid Layers:**
 * Supports "mix mode" where layers come from both:
 * - JSX children: `<layer layer={...} />`
 * - Direct prop: `<DeckGL layers={[...]} />`
 *
 * The `_passedLayers` from the store are prepended to JSX layers.
 *
 * **Deck.gl Integration:**
 * Calls `deckgl.setProps({ layers, views })` which triggers Deck.gl's ID-based diffing.
 * Deck.gl efficiently determines what changed and only updates affected layers/views.

 * - Efficient: Deck.gl's diffing is highly optimized for full tree updates
 * - Reliable: Single source of truth, no accumulation of stale state

/**
 * Attaches a child instance to its parent during initial tree construction.
 *
 * React calls this during the render phase when building the initial tree structure.
 * After `createInstance` creates both parent and child, this method links them together
 * by adding the child to the parent's children array.
 *
 * **Render Phase Constraints:**
 * - CAN mutate `parentInstance` and `child` (they're newly created)
 * - CANNOT modify any other nodes in the tree
 * - CANNOT perform side effects that assume the tree will be committed
 * - Tree is still being built and not yet on screen
 *
 * **Parent-Child Relationship Building:**
 * In React's tree construction order:
 * 1. `createInstance(child)` - Create child
 * 2. `createInstance(parent)` - Create parent
 * 3. `appendInitialChild(parent, child)` - Link them
 * 4. `finalizeInitialChildren(parent)` - Finalize parent
 *
 * React builds trees bottom-up, creating children before parents.
 *
 * **Why Direct Mutation is Safe:**
 * Both parent and child are newly created in this render pass and not yet visible to
 * other parts of the system, so mutation is safe despite being in render phase.
 *
 * **Deck.gl Tree Structure:**
 * We maintain a parallel tree structure that mirrors React's tree but uses Deck.gl
 * layers. The children array will be flattened later in `replaceContainerChildren`.
 *
 * @param parentInstance - Parent instance to append to (newly created)
 * @param child - Child instance to append (newly created)

 *
 * **Render Phase - Final Initialization:**
 * At this point:
 * - Instance is created
 * - All initial children are attached
 * - Instance is NOT yet in the committed tree
 * - Still safe to mutate the instance
 *
 * **Return Value Controls `commitMount`:**
 * - `true` = Schedule `commitMount(instance)` to run in commit phase
 * - `false` = No commit-time work needed (most common)
 *
 * Use `true` when you need to perform side effects that depend on the instance being
 * committed (e.g., DOM focus, measuring, event registration). Deck.gl layers are pure
 * descriptors with no commit-time side effects, so we return `false`.
 *
 * **When to Return True (commitMount):**
 * Examples from other renderers:
 * - DOM: Return true for `<input autoFocus>` to focus in commit phase
 * - Canvas: Return true to measure text dimensions (requires canvas context)
 * - Custom: Any setup that requires the element to be "live" on screen
 *
 * **Deck.gl Implementation:**
 * Returns `false` because Deck.gl layers don't need commit-time initialization.
 * They're declarative descriptors that become active when passed to `deckgl.setProps()`
 * in `replaceContainerChildren`, which happens automatically without needing `commitMount`.
 *
 * @param instance - Instance to finalize (with all children attached)

 *
 * **Mutation Mode vs Persistence Mode:**
 * - **Mutation mode**: Uses `prepareUpdate` + `commitUpdate` to mutate existing instances

 * so React never calls this method. We provide a stub for type compatibility.

 * **Why Persistence Mode:**
 * Deck.gl layers are cheap descriptor objects designed to be recreated on every update.

 *
 * **Render Phase Behavior:**
 * - Called during render phase before creating children

 *
 * **Return Value Meaning:**
 * - `true` = React skips creating text nodes, expects you to handle text in `createInstance`

 * - `false` = React creates text nodes normally via `createTextInstance`

 * - Element type is a text-only container (like `<textarea>`)
 * - Children are a single string and element supports `textContent`-style optimization
 * - Your renderer can efficiently set text directly on parent

 * **Deck.gl Implementation:**

 *
 * **Host Context Purpose:**
 * Context carries information about "where you are" in the tree that affects how instances
 * are created. Examples from other renderers:
 * - DOM: Tracks HTML vs SVG namespace (`<div>` creates HTMLElement, `<circle>` creates SVGElement)

 *
 * **Render Phase Behavior:**

 * **Deck.gl Context Usage:**
 * We use context to:
 * 1. Provide Zustand store access to all instances
 * 2. Track View nesting (via `insideView` flag added in `getChildHostContext`)
 *
 * The root context contains just the store. As React renders the tree, `getChildHostContext`
 * adds the `insideView` flag when entering View elements.
 *
 * @param rootContainer - Container passed to `createContainer` (contains store)

 *
 * // React calls getRootHostContext:
 * const rootContext = getRootHostContext(container);
