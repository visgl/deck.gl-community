When run() is invoked it subscribes to graph mutation events (node/edge add/remove and transaction boundaries) so it can mark the layout \u201cdirty\u201d and call updateGraph/update once a transaction finishes, ensuring the layout sees incremental topology changes as a batch. At the same time it listens to the layout\u2019s own lifecycle events and simply re-dispatches them from the engine, acting as the single source consumers watch for animation progress. Because GraphLayout increments its version every time _onLayoutChange() runs, the engine\u2019s getLayoutLastUpdate()/getLayoutState() accessors expose monotonically increasing values that can be used as change triggers for rendering layers."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Events the viewer must observe\nThe built-in GraphLayer demonstrates the expected wiring: after creating and run()ning a GraphEngine, it subscribes to the engine\u2019s onLayoutChange event and calls forceUpdate() so deck.gl re-queries node/edge positions on every layout iteration. The layer also threads the engine\u2019s layout version and state into each sub-layer\u2019s positionUpdateTrigger, which ensures deck.gl\u2019s diffing system invalidates attributes whenever the layout reports a new tick."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If you are orchestrating the engine yourself, you need to reproduce the same wiring: instantiate a GraphEngine, call run(), listen for its onLayoutChange (and optionally onLayoutStart/onLayoutDone) events, and on each notification trigger whatever re-render or animation step your application uses. Because the engine only fires those events when the underlying layout raises them, the visual stays in sync with incremental layout calculations."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},77918:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":"modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/layout-animation","title":"layout-animation","description":"Layout Animation","source":"@site/../docs/modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/layout-animation.md","sourceDirName":"modules/graph-layers/developer-guide","slug":"/modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/layout-animation","permalink":"/deck.gl-community/docs/modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/layout-animation","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl-community/tree/master/website/../docs/modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/layout-animation.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","previous":{"title":"Interactions","permalink":"/deck.gl-community/docs/modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/interactions"},"next":{"title":"Layouts","permalink":"/deck.gl-community/docs/modules/graph-layers/developer-guide/layouts"}}')}}]);
