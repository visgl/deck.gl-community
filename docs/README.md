# Community Modules

This repository contains a collection of community supported modules for [deck.gl](https://deck.gl).

The modules in this repository are intended to be used together with deck.gl. 

Note that these modules are not officially supported by the deck.gl team, but have at least some part-time support from one or more community members.

## Incubation

There is a high bar when adding new code to themain deck.gl repository. The deck.gl-community repository is sometimes used to prepare (incubate) new software components so that they are ready to be added to deck.gl. 

When proposing the addition of a new component, such as a new deck.gl layer,
to the core deck.gl maintainers, it is helpful to be able to prepare the component together with tests, documentation and examples outside of the core repository but within a similar code environment.

To be clear, many components in this repository are not intended to be added to the main deck.gl repository.

## Longevity

The continued inclusion of each module into this repository depends to a large extent on whether there is sufficient community interest in supporting the module. Modules can be removed if the core deck.gl team feels that there is no longer sufficient support.

## Contributing a module

If you have a module that you think could fit into this repository, open an issue or PR and start a discussion, or reach out in the OpenJS slack.
