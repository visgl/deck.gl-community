# Overview

:::danger
The deck.gl-community repo is specifically set up to collect useful code that no longer has dedicated maintainers. This means that there is often no one who can respond quickly to issues. The vis.gl / Open Visualization team members who try to keep this running can only put a few hours into it every now and then. It is important to understand this limitation. If your project depends on timely fixes, and you are not able to contribute them yourself, deck.gl-community modules may not be the right choice for you.

There is an ambition to phase out React specific code for deck.gl-community modules. This model is expected to be deprecated in the near future.
