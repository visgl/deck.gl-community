## Abstract
graph-layers is a React component for visualizing large graphs with several utility functions. It can build a highly customizable graph visualization through its composable API. The rendering is powered by deck.gl which is a WebGL based visualization framework.  With graph-layers, users are enabled to build various type of graph/network applications with minimum efforts while having the capability to extend the existing styles and layouts.

## Motivation
Uber originally started this project as Graph.gl. After stopping efforts on Graph.gl, the OpenJS Foundation has resumed efforts.

With graph-layers, developers are allowed to create graph visualization with minimum efforts while having the capability to override anything they want in the library.

## Roadmap

TBD, we've just started a reboot to update dependencies and modernize the codebase to reflect current React best practices.

## Get Started
```js
import GraphGL, {
  JSONLoader,
  NODE_TYPE,
  D3ForceLayout
} from 'deck-graph-layers';

const App = ({data}) => {
  const graph = JSONLoader({
    json: data,
    nodeParser: node => ({id: node.id}),
    edgeParser: edge => ({
      id: edge.id,
      sourceId: edge.sourceId,
      targetId: edge.targetId,
      directed: true,
    }),
  });
  return (
    <GraphGL
      graph={graph}
      layout={new D3ForceLayout()}
      nodeStyle={[
        {
          type: NODE_TYPE.CIRCLE,
          radius: 10,
          fill: 'blue',
          opacity: 1,
        },
      ]}
      edgeStyle={{
        stroke: 'black',
        strokeWidth: 2,
      }}
      enableDragging
    />
  );
}
