# Overview

:::danger
The deck.gl-community repo is specifically set up to collect useful code that no longer has dedicated maintainers. This means that there is often no one who can respond quickly to issues. The vis.gl / Open Visualization team members who try to keep this running can only put a few hours into it every now and then. It is important to understand this limitation. If your project depends on timely fixes, and you are not able to contribute them yourself, deck.gl-community modules may not be the right choice for you.

`graph-layers` is a deck.gl layer pack for GPU-powered visualization of large graphs. 

With graph-layers, developers can build various type of graph/network applications with minimum effort. 
The composable API enables highly customizable graph visualization by leveraging or even extending the provided graph *styles* and *layout algorithms*.

## History

`graph-layers` started out as a friendly fork of Uber's archived [graph.gl](https://graph.gl/gatsby/) framework, 
bringing the graph.gl code up-to-date with the latest deck.gl versions. 

## What's New

- upgraded to work with deck.gl v9 
- npm version number now aligned with deck.gl version.

### `deck-graph-layers` v0.0.1

Release date: April 14, 2023

An initial fork of Uber's [graph.gl](https://github.com/uber/graph.gl) repository.
