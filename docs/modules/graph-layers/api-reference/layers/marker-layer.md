## How to add new markers

- The marker image has to be 32x32 pixels with transparent background in PNG format. The marker itself should be at the center of the image.

- Add the new marker into `markers` folder. Note that the file name will be the name of the marker.

- Go to folder 'scripts' and run `sh scripts/packing.sh` to generate four files: `marker-atlas.png`, `atlas-data-url.js`, `marker-list.js`, and `marker-mapping.js`.

- Go back to the root level of this repo (mlvis-toolkit), and run `yarn prettier` to fix the linter errors.

- Commit changes and create a diff for review (reviewer: `#mlvis`)
