# Overview

A collection of generic react components to use with deck.gl

> After the introduction of widgets in deck.gl 9.1, the general direction is to develop components as widgets (these work in all deck.gl environments, not just React) and phase out older React components.

The deck.gl-community repo is specifically set up to collect useful code that no longer has dedicated maintainers. This means that there is often no one who can respond quickly to issues. The vis.gl / Open Visualization team members who try to keep this running can only put a few hours into it every now and then. It is important to understand this limitation. If your project depends on timely fixes, and you are not able to contribute them yourself, deck.gl-community modules may not be the right choice for you.
