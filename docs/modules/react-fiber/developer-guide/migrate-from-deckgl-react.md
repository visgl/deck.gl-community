# Upgrade guide

This page lists the changes to make when you move to `@deck.gl-community/react-fiber` from
[`@deck.gl/react`](#from-deckglreact) or from the earlier
[`@deckgl-fiber-renderer/dom`](#from-deckgl-fiber-rendererdom) package. Start with
[Write JSX](#write-jsx), which shows the syntax both upgrades end up with.

## Requirements

- React 19 or later.
- The deck.gl 9.4 package family.
- TypeScript 5.3 or later, if you use TypeScript.
- A client module: in an app that uses React Server Components, import `DeckGL` from a
  `'use client'` module. See [Get started](./get-started.md).

## Write JSX

Import the root, and import a component for each deck.gl class from the subpath named after its
deck.gl module. Install the deck.gl package behind each subpath you import.

```tsx
import {DeckGL} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber';
import {MapView} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber/core';
import {ScatterplotLayer} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber/layers';
import {ZoomWidget} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber/widgets';

<DeckGL initialViewState={INITIAL_VIEW_STATE} controller>
  <MapView id="main" />
  <ScatterplotLayer id="points" data={data} getPosition={d => d.position} />
  <ZoomWidget id="zoom" />
</DeckGL>;
```

| Subpath | Components |
| --- | --- |
| `/core` | The views, `LightingEffect` and `PostProcessEffect` |
| `/layers`, `/geo-layers`, `/aggregation-layers`, `/mesh-layers` | Every layer in that deck.gl module |
| `/widgets` | Every widget in `@deck.gl/widgets` |

Components can sit at any depth inside your own components, which can use hooks and context.
Props are checked against the class, and layer components take its type parameters. For a custom
class, make a component once with `createLayerComponent`, `createViewComponent`,
`createWidgetComponent` or `createEffectComponent`, exported from the root. To render an instance
you built yourself, use `<deckLayer layer={layer} />`, `<deckView>`, `<deckWidget>` or
`<deckEffect>`. See [Components](../api-reference/components.md) and
[Native elements](../api-reference/native-elements.md).

## From `@deck.gl/react`

### Change the imports

The root is a named export. Import layers, views and widgets from the React Fiber subpaths
instead of the deck.gl modules; the JSX stays the same.

```tsx
// Before
import DeckGL from '@deck.gl/react';
import {MapView} from '@deck.gl/core';
import {ScatterplotLayer} from '@deck.gl/layers';
import {ZoomWidget} from '@deck.gl/react';

// After
import {DeckGL} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber';
import {MapView} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber/core';
import {ScatterplotLayer} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber/layers';
import {ZoomWidget} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber/widgets';
```

The root takes the same deck.gl props, renders the same wrapper and canvas, and orders the
`layers` and `views` props against JSX the same way. See
[Root DOM and sizing](../api-reference/deckgl.md#root-dom-and-sizing).

For a `MapboxOverlay` or `MapLibreOverlay`, import `DeckGL` from `/mapbox` or `/maplibre` and
attach the overlay to the map you create. See [Using with maps](./using-with-maps.md).

### Replace `DeckGLRef`

The root's `ref` receives the `Deck` instance, or the overlay on a map root. Picking calls stay
the same; replace `deckRef.current.deck` with `deckRef.current`:

```tsx
// Before
const deckRef = useRef<DeckGLRef>(null);
deckRef.current?.pickObject({x, y});

// After
const deckRef = useRef<Deck>(null);
deckRef.current?.pickObject({x, y});
```

To re-render when the instance is created or torn down, store it in state with `onDeckChange`.
`DeckGLContext` has no equivalent; pass the instance through your own context or props.

### Remove unsupported children

- **HTML and function children.** `DeckGL` children may only be deck.gl components, native
  elements, and components that render them. Render HTML overlays as siblings of `DeckGL` in a
  positioned container. For per-view content, read viewports with `deck.getViewports()`.
- **react-map-gl `<Map>` as a child.** Create the map yourself and use a map root. See
  [Reverse-controlled maps](./using-with-maps.md#reverse-controlled-maps).
- **`useWidget`.** Make a component for a custom widget with `createWidgetComponent`.
- **A custom `Deck` class.** For a custom overlay, use
  [`createDeckGL`](../api-reference/deckgl.md#custom-compatible-overlays).

Nesting a layer inside a view does not assign it to that view, as in `@deck.gl/react`. Use
deck.gl's `layerFilter` for per-view layers.

## From `@deckgl-fiber-renderer/dom`

### Change the package and root

```tsx
// Before
import {Deckgl} from '@deckgl-fiber-renderer/dom';

// After
import {DeckGL} from '@deck.gl-community/react-fiber';
```

### Rename the elements, or switch to components

`<layer>` and `<view>` are now `<deckLayer>` and `<deckView>`. Every root also has them as
`DeckGL.Layer` and `DeckGL.View`. To drop the `new` calls, use the components instead:

```tsx
// Before
<layer layer={new ScatterplotLayer({id: 'points', data})} />
<view view={new MapView({id: 'main'})} />

// After, with native elements
<deckLayer layer={new ScatterplotLayer({id: 'points', data})} />
<deckView view={new MapView({id: 'main'})} />

// After, with components
<ScatterplotLayer id="points" data={data} />
<MapView id="main" />
```

Elements registered with `extend()`, such as `<scatterplotLayer>`, become components: import the
built-in ones from a subpath, and make the others with `createLayerComponent`.

### Replace `useDeckgl`

`useDeckgl()` is gone. Receive the instance from the root's `ref` or `onDeckChange`.

For a map, replace `<Deckgl interleaved>` inside react-map-gl, and its `useControl` bridge, with
the `DeckGL` root from `/maplibre` or `/mapbox`. The root can stay inside `<Map>`. Receive the
overlay it creates through `onDeckChange`, and add it to the map with `map.addControl` once the map
has loaded. See [Attach the overlay to the host map](./using-with-maps.md#attach-the-overlay-to-the-host-map),
and the [MapLibre](./base-maps/using-with-maplibre.md) and [Mapbox](./base-maps/using-with-mapbox.md)
guides for the full pattern with React Map GL.
